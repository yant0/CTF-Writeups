> [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space), or [hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue "Hue") [saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(color_theory) "Saturation (color theory)") [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_value "Color value"), stores color information in three channels, just like RGB, but one channel is devoted to brightness (value), and the other two convey colour information. The value channel is similar to (but not exactly the same as) the CMYK black channel, or its [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography) "Negative (photography)").
